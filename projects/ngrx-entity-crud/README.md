# NgrxEntityCrud
This library helps create the CRUD Angular application that makes use of NgRx, provides actions, reducers and selectors for the CRUD management of the entities.

How did I get to this result?

1) I adopted this best practice:   
[NgRx — Best Practices for Enterprise Angular Applications](https://itnext.io/ngrx-best-practices-for-enterprise-angular-applications-6f00bcdf36d7)

2) I found a mechanism to reduced repeated code in my projects, after reading this article:   
[How to Reduce Action Boilerplate](https://redux.js.org/recipes/reducing-boilerplate)

3) [Schematics for Libraries](https://angular.io/guide/schematics-for-libraries).

# How to use it?
